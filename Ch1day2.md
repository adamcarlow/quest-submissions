### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
  - Safety and Security: strong type system, seperation between contracts/transactions and resource oriented programming.
  - Clarity: declaritive and easy to read code.
  - Approachability: Cadence is written in a familiar way to other programming languages.
  - Developer Experience: Cadence makes error messages clear for easy debugging.
  - Resource Oriented Programming: Resources are a composite data type, similar to a struct, that expresses direct ownership of assets. Cadence's resources directly tie ownership of an asset to the account that owns it using the account's own resources.
  

### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
  - I think the five pillars are useful in that it shows there is a plan and a developer a community behind Cadence in order to apply best practices.  These pillars can help to gain more developers to want to build in the Cadence and Flow ecosystem.
